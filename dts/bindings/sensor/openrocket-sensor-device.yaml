      Lag after the ground truth that this sensor measures.
      Some devices (like a barometer) don't update super fast. 
      Use this parameter to control that 
  sampling-period-us:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      What frequency does the sensor update at. The simulated sensor will 
      only update at this rate no matter how the underlying data changes 
      beneath it or how often the use calls `sensor_channel_fetch`.
      A value of 0 (the default) signifies the the value will interpolated 
      to read as fast as `sensor_channel_fetch` is called.
