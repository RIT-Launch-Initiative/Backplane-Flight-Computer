compatible: "openrocket,imu"

include: [openrocket-sensor-device.yaml]

properties:
  vertical-axis:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Which axis is up (the direction the rocket goes)
      Options:
      - X
      - Y
      - Z
    enum:
      - "X"
      - "Y"
      - "Z"
      
  vertical-axis-invert:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If set, invert the vertical axis (multiply by -1). 
      This is helpful if your actual IMU is upside down

    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Which axis is sideways
      Options:
      - X
      - Y
      - Z
    enum:
      - "X"
      - "Y"
      - "Z"

    required: true
    description: |
      Which axis is roll
