      What frequency does the sensor update at. The simulated sensor will 
      only update at this rate no matter how the underlying data changes 
      beneath it or how often the use calls `sensor_channel_fetch`.
      A value of 0 (the default) signifies the the value will interpolated 
      to read as fast as `sensor_channel_fetch` is called.
# Which axis is the vertical axis
# What method to use to map 1d lateral acceleration to the remaining 2 axes
