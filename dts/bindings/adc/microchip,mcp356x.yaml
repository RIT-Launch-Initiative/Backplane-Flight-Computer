description: Microchip MCP356X (1,2,4 Channel ADCs)

compatible: "microchip,mcp356x"


properties:
  "#io-channel-cells":
    type: int
    required: true
  name:
    type: string


  device-address:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Each MCP356X has a device address hardwired in the chip and printed on the package.
      The device address can be used to talk to multiple chips using 1 chip select line (sort of like i2c)

      Clock Selection
      - CLK_EXTERNAL: MCLK = clock on the analog master clock output pin
      - CLK_INTERNAL: MCLK = integrated clock. analog master clock output pin follows integrated clock
      - CLK_INTERNAL_NO_BROADCAST: MCLK = integrated clock. analog master clock output pin does NOT follow integrated clock
    enum:
      - "CLK_EXTERNAL"
      - "CLK_INTERNAL"
      - "CLK_INTERNAL_NO_BROADCAST"

      Prescaler setting
      - PRE_8: AMCLK = MCLK/8
