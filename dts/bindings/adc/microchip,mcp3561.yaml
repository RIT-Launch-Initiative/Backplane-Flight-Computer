    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Each MCP356X has a device address hardwired in the chip and printed on the package.
      The device address can be used to talk to multiple chips using 1 chip select line (like i2c)

      Clock Selection
      - CLK_EXTERNAL: MCLK = clock on the analog master clock output pin
      - CLK_INTERNAL: MCLK = integrated clock. analog master clock output pin follows integrated clock
      - CLK_INTERNAL_NO_BROADCAST: MCLK = integrated clock. analog master clock output pin does NOT follow integrated clock
    enum:
      - "CLK_EXTERNAL"
