    description: |
      Mapping of DIO 0 pin. 
      The meaning of the mapping changes depending on what mode the radio is in (Packet,Continous,LoRa)
      Ensure that the mode here agrees with `data-mode` and `long-range-mode`.
      If you change modes at runtime, check these mappings as well.
      Continous Mode:
      - RfmDio0Mapping_Continuous_SyncAddressTxReady:  SyncAddress in Rx mode, TxReady in Tx mode, Nothing in all other modes.
      - RfmDio0Mapping_Continuous_RssiPreambleDetect:  Rssi/PreambleDetect in Rx mode, Nothing in all other modes.
      - RfmDio0Mapping_Continuous_RxReadyTxReady:      RxReady in Rx mode, TxReady in Tx mode,  Nothing in all other modes.
      - RfmDio0Mapping_Continuous_Nothing:             Nothing in all modes.
      Packet Mode:
      - RfmDio0Mapping_Packet_PayloadReadyPacketSent: PayloadReady in Rx mode, PacketSent in Tx mode, Nothing in all other modes.
      - RfmDio0Mapping_Packet_RxCrcOk:                CrcOk in Rx mode, Nothing in all other modes.
      - RfmDio0Mapping_Packet_Nothing:                Nothing in all modes.
